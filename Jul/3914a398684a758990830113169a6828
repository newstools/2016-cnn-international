(CNN)Here's a look at the International Criminal Court (ICC), a court comprised of 123 states from around the world. Facts Although created by the Rome Statute, a treaty first brought before the United Nations, the ICC operates as an independent entity. The court is located in The Hague, Netherlands. The ICC is the "court of last resort," and came into force on July 1, 2002. The court tries four types of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. It is not intended to replace a national justice system. Currently, 137 states are signatories, but only 123 are considered parties to the treaty.
